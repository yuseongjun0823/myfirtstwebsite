        <h2>Service Model</h2>
        <p>Though service-oriented architecture advocates "Everything as a service" (with the acronyms EaaS or XaaS,or simply aas), cloud-computing providers offer their "services" according to different models, of which the three standard models per NIST are Infrastructure as a Service (<strong>IaaS</strong>), Platform as a Service (<strong>PaaS</strong>), and Software as a Service (<strong>SaaS</strong>).These models offer increasing abstraction; they are thus often portrayed as layers in a stack: infrastructure-, platform- and software-as-a-service, but these need not be related. For example, one can provide SaaS implemented on physical machines (bare metal), without using underlying PaaS or IaaS layers, and conversely one can run a program on IaaS and access it directly, without wrapping it as SaaS. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</p>
